### Code Quality
- **Total Lines of Code**: ~1,900+ lines
- **ESLint**: Configured with React Native preset
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Testing**: Jest setup with initial test
- **Security**: No vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Navigation Pattern
Chose **Bottom Tab Navigation** for:
- Easy access to all main features
- Familiar mobile UI pattern
- Clear visual indicators of current screen
- Icon-based navigation with emojis for visual appeal

### 2. Modal-Based Forms
Used modals for data entry (compose message, book room, make payment) because:
- Maintains context without navigation
- Prevents back-stack clutter
- Smooth user experience with slide animations
- Easy to dismiss and return to previous state

### 3. Card-Based Layout
Implemented card design throughout for:
- Visual hierarchy and organization
- Easy scanning of information
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Consistent spacing and shadows

### 4. Color Scheme
Primary blue (#007AFF) chosen for:
- Professional appearance
- iOS-friendly (native feel)
- Good contrast and accessibility
- Trust and reliability association

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
✅ Input validation on forms
✅ Disabled state for unavailable actions
✅ Clear security notes for production deployment
✅ No hardcoded credentials or secrets
✅ CodeQL security scan passed with zero alerts

### Production Requirements (Documented)
⚠️ Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, Braintree)
⚠️ PCI DSS compliance for card processing
⚠️ Secure backend API for sensitive data
⚠️ HTTPS-only communication
⚠️ User authentication and authorization
⚠️ Data encryption at rest and in transit
⚠️ Input sanitization and validation on backend
